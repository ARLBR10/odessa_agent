# Project Memory

This file preserves durable facts and decisions from prior sessions. It is context, not proof: re-verify safety-critical facts against the physical phone and current source before flashing or making compatibility claims.

## Current state

- The user has already prepared the LineageOS build environment.
- Use the current LineageOS build guide as the workflow baseline, starting from the `tucana` build guide's “Preparing the build environment” flow: <https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/tucana/build/variant1/#preparing-the-build-environment>.
- Do not assume `tucana` device-specific commands, repositories, firmware, partition layout, or images apply to `odessa`; adapt the workflow using verified `odessa` data.
- The agent is expected to create and maintain the required device-specific configuration, kernel integration, manifests, proprietary-file integration, and related bring-up code rather than asking the user to author C/C++ or Android device-tree code.

## Known source leads

- Historical/incomplete LineageOS `odessa` device repository: <https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_motorola_odessa>. Treat it as evidence and a migration baseline, not as a complete or currently compatible device tree.
- The `sm7150-mainline` organization contains postmarketOS/Linux-mainline work: <https://github.com/sm7150-mainline>. It may provide hardware, SoC, device-tree, and driver clues, but it is not automatically suitable for the Android/LineageOS kernel and userspace architecture.
- Existing Motorola `sm6150-common`, sibling-device, kernel, vendor, and firmware sources still need to be researched and pinned before selecting the implementation baseline.

## Working decisions

- Follow branch-current LineageOS conventions rather than copying a tutorial device's configuration.
- Reuse verified upstream code where compatible; write the missing `odessa`-specific pieces in this project.
- Keep postmarketOS/mainline Linux information as a research input only unless a component is shown to fit the selected Android kernel and vendor interfaces.
- No flashing occurs during initial discovery and source research.
